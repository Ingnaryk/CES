# CES
simple C++ implements of some data structures and objects in ECMAScript with their basic properties and methods. The purpose for this repository is to absorb modern grammer thoughts

What I learn about new C++(11~20) featrues:
- std::variant, used to simulate 'any' type
- std::initializer_list, used to be passed as a simple array through functions
- std::fucntion/std::bind, used to enrich the ways calling functions
- std::optional, used to better describe a type with no-value implication
- std::future/std::promise, use to implement async operations
- template metaprogramming skills, like variadic templates, explicit deduction guide, etc.
