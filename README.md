# CES
simple C++ implements of some data structures and objects in ECMAScript with their basic properties and methods. The purpose for this repository is,

on the one hand, to absorb modern grammer skills and thoughts

on the other hand, to learn new C++(11~20) featrues like std::variant, std::initializer_list, std::fucntion, std::optional, std::reference_wrapper, variadic templates and so on.

while dealing with objects, I haven't used shared_ptr or anything else to manage the reference count, assignments are just of deep copy.
